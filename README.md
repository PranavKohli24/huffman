huffman code is done to compress a file .
it basically works on principle that characters with more frequency ===> less bytes/bits
it is a way of compressing data without data losing any information in process.
it is useful in cases where there is a series of frequently occuring characters.
Here is the python code implementation for the same which takes a file and compresses it .
